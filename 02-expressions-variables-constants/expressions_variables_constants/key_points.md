Code comments are denoted by a line starting with //, or by multiple lines bookended with /* and */.

You can use print to write to the debug console.

## The arithmetic operators are:

    Addition: +
    Subtraction: -
    Multiplication: *
    Division: /
    Truncating division: ~/
    Modulo (remainder): %

Dart has many functions including min, max, sqrt, sin and cos. You’ll learn many more throughout this book.

Constants and variables give names to data. Once you’ve declared a constant, you can’t change its data, but you can change a variable’s data at any time.

If a variable’s type can be inferred, you can replace the type with the var keyword. The const keyword is used for compile-time constants while final is used for runtime constants.

Always give variables and constants meaningful names to save yourself and your colleagues headaches later.

## Operators that perform arithmetic, and then assign back to the variable, are:

    Add and assign: +=
    Subtract and assign: -=
    Multiply and assign: *=
    Divide and assign: /=
    Increment by 1: ++
    Decrement by 1: --
