# Key Points

### Functions package related blocks of code into reusable units.

### A function signature includes the return type, name and parameters. The function body is the code between the braces.

### Parameters can be positional or named, and required or optional.

### Side effects are anything, besides the return value, that change the world outside of the function body.

### To write clean code, use functions that are short and only do one thing.

### Anonymous functions donâ€™t have a function name, and the return type is inferred.

### Dart functions are first-class citizens and thus can be assigned to variables and passed around as values.

### Anonymous functions act as closures, capturing any variables or functions within its scope.

### Arrow syntax is a shorthand way to write one-line functions.
