# Key Points

### You use the Boolean data type bool to represent true and false.

### The comparison operators, all of which return a Boolean, are:

    equal ==
    not equal !=
    less than <
    greater than >
    less than or equal <=
    greater than or equal >=

### You can use Boolean logic (&& and ||) to combine comparison conditions.

### You use if statements to make simple decisions based on a condition.

### You use else and else-if within an if statement to extend the decision making beyond a single condition.

### Variables and constants belong to a certain scope, beyond which you cannot use them. A scope inherits variables and ### constants from its parent.

### You can use the ternary operator (a ? b : c) in place of simple if statements.

### You can use switch statements to decide which code to run depending on the value ofa variable or constant.

### Enumerated types define a new type with a finite list of distinct values.

### *while* loops perform a certain task repeatedly as long as a condition is true.

### *do-while* loops always execute the loop at least once.

### The *break* statement lets you break out of a loop.

### *for loops* allow you to perform a loop a set number of times.

### The *continue* statement ends the current iteration of a loop and begins the next iteration.
