# Key Points

### Type conversion allows you to convert values of one type into another.

### When doing operations with basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and mixed types, the result will be a double.

### Type inference allows you to omit the type when Dart can figure it out.

### Unicode is the standard representation for mapping characters to numbers.

### Dart uses UTF-16 values known as code units to encode Unicode strings.

### A single mapping in Unicode is called a code point, which is known as a rune in Dart.

### User-perceived characters may be composed of one or more code points and are called grapheme characters.

### You can combine strings by using the addition operator.

### You can make multi-line strings using three single-quotes or double quotes.

### You can use string interpolation to build a string in-place.

### Dart is an optionally-typed language. While itâ€™s preferable to choose statically-typed variables, you may write Dart code in a dynamically-typed way by explicitly adding the dynamic type annotation in front of variables.
